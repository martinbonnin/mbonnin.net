# New website !

Like [many others](http://nanoc.ws/about/#similar-projects), I give up on wordpress and move my blog to static pages. There is plenty of discussion over the web about the rationale behind this. Basically:

- no more database to maintain
- faster
- ability to write my posts with my favorite editor
- easy version control
- markdown support
- ...

This was also an opportunity to learn python (good) and css3 (not good).

I wasted far too much time trying to understand the HTML box model. Or I should rather say the various HTML box models. I hate "table-cell" and "margin: auto". Trying to center something vertically was quite complicated. Getting a 'div' to have a display aspect ratio independant from the viewport resolution was more like brain torture.

# Source code

I am a bit out of time right now so the code is still quite messy. I won't say it is as messy as the wordpress code but still not very clean. That was not really the initial goal. Anyway, it's all available on <a href="https://github.com/martinbonnin/mbonnin.net">github</a> of course.

# Coming soon

- phone support (aka responsive, fluid, grid, media-query, [insert your favorite buzzword here]). **edit 2014/01/09: done :-)**
- nicer 404 error.
- syntax highlighting for code sections
- some markdown fixes.

Hope it'll work correctly. Please tell <a href="mailto:martin@mbonnin.net">me</a> if it does not.
