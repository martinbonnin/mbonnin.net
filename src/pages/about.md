Hiya ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my place on the internet. I used to do lots of Graphics, now I'm deep in [GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-kotlin) and [Gradle](https://github.com/GradleUp/gratatouille). I also love cats and cakes!

See you around at the next [Paris Android User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/android-paris/) or in the [KotlinLang slack](https://kotl.in/slack).

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), using the [Astrowind theme](https://astrowind.vercel.app/) and hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting).
